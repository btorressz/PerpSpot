# Perp Spot - Crypto Arbitrage Platform

## Overview 

A sophisticated cryptocurrency perpetuals arbitrage trading platform called "Perp Spot Crypto Arbitrage" that bridges Jupiter spot trading with Hyperliquid perpetual futures. Features real-time WebSocket data feeds with mainnet/testnet fallback, arbitrage opportunity detection, interactive dashboard with Chart.js visualization, execution latency modeling, Monte Carlo simulation modeling, advanced slippage management with standardized color-coded visualization (Green â‰¤50bps, Orange 50-200bps, Red >200bps), comprehensive analytics including Z-score spread detection and VaR calculations, Redis-backed caching, trading simulation capabilities, and dynamic token discovery supporting 100+ cryptocurrency pairs.

**NOTE** I am still reviewing and developing this project feedback is welcome, this is the first version it won't be perfect, but it runs.
